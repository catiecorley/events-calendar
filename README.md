Creative portion: The calendar has national holidays posted which are being fetched from a free API ( https://rapidapi.com/theapiguy/api/public-holiday/ ). These holidays display on all of the users' calendars, including the guest view of the calendar. 
The calendar also supports adding a meeting link to events (for zoom meetings etc). This link is optional to add and, if it is added, it will be clickable in a list under the calendar month view.
